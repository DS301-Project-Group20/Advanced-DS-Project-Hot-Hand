# Advanced-DS-Project-Hot-Hand
The Project of Advanced Topics in Data Science 2025 Fall, Group 20. The Hot Hand Phenomenon.

by Leon Wang, Peter Hu, Yuan Li

In this project, we investigated the hot hand phenomenon in NBA games. Our work is based on the work of Pelechrinis and Winston (2022). See

In our project, 
1. We develop a shot-make prediction model using LightGBM that achieves a slightly better accuracy than Pelechrinis and Winston’s deep learning model.

2. We develop a new statistical test - streak number test - and find strong evidence that the hot hand exists in NBA games.

3. We test ChatGPT’s responses to hot hand questions and find it can correctly identify the statistical definition of hot hand and perform some statistical estimation on real data.
